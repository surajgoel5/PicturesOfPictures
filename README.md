# PicturesOfPictures
The program creates a collage by resizing a big picure and seeting each pixel of that big picture with another smaller picture.

# Usage

Look at the comments in the code

If ncols and nrows are too small, the main image may be unrecognizable. To deal with it, an overlayed image is created that superposes the high resolution image over the whole collage, making it more recognizable. Keep the overlaying parameter to be more than 1. The higher it is, the lesser the effect of the superposition ;)
